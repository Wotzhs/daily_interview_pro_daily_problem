This repo is the collection of my attempts at Daily Interview Pro's Daily Problem.

Due to the frequency of duplicate problems over very short period, such problems _may_ simply be skipped unless I have trouble re-implementing my previous solution or I have a better/different solution.

_Update 2020/10/04_: I think I may have unsubscribed from the daily interview pro mailing list as I stopped receiving daily interview problems. So I am working backwards instead to the date I first received the problems.
